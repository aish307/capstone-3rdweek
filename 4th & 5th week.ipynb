Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.\n\nThe idea of this study is to help people planning to open a new restaurant in Toronto to chose the right location by providing data about the income and population of each neighborhood as well as the competitors already present on the same r regions.\n\n<B>2) Data</B>\nDescribe the data that you will be using to solve the problem or execute your idea. Remember that you will need to use the Foursquare location data to solve the problem or execute your idea. You can absolutely use other datasets in combination with the Foursquare location data. So make sure that you provide adequate explanation and discussion, with examples, of the data that you will be using, even if it is only Foursquare location data.\n\nTo provide the stakeholders the necessary information I'll be combining Toronto's 2016 Census that contains Population, Average income per Neighborhood with Foursquare API to collect competitors on the same neighborhoods.\n\nToronto's Census data in publicly available at this website: https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#8c732154-5012-9afe-d0cd-ba3ffc813d5a\n\nBefore we get the data and start exploring it, let's download all the dependencies that we will need."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "import numpy as np # library to handle data in a vectorized manner\n\nimport pandas as pd # library for data analsysis\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)\npd.set_option('display.max_rows', None)\n\n!conda install -c conda-forge geopy --yes # uncomment this line if you haven't completed the Foursquare API lab\nfrom geopy.geocoders import Nominatim # convert an address into latitude and longitude values\n\n!conda install -c conda-forge folium=0.5.0 --yes # uncomment this line if you haven't completed the Foursquare API lab\nimport folium # map rendering library", "execution_count": null, "outputs": [{"output_type": "stream", "text": "Solving environment: done\n\n# All requested packages already installed.\n\nSolving environment: \\ ", "name": "stdout"}]}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "<B>2.1) Download and Explore Dataset</B>\nUsing data from 2016 census to collect Toronto's income per neighborhood"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "# Toronto Open Data Catalogue - Neighbourhood Profiles 2016 (CSV)\n# https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#8c732154-5012-9afe-d0cd-ba3ffc813d5a\n\ncsv_path='https://www.toronto.ca/ext/open_data/catalog/data_set_files/2016_neighbourhood_profiles.csv'\ndf = pd.read_csv(csv_path,encoding='latin1')\ndf.head()", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Colecting neighborhoods names"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "Neighbourhoods = list(df.columns.values)\nNeighbourhoods = Neighbourhoods[5:]", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "<b>Collecting Population per neighborhood</b>\n\nCreating a new dataset"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "dfToronto = pd.DataFrame(index=Neighbourhoods, columns=[\"Population_2016\",\"Income_2016\"])\ndfToronto.head()\n", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "for index, row in dfToronto.iterrows():\n    dfToronto.at[index, 'Population_2016'] = df[index][2]\n    dfToronto.at[index, 'Income_2016'] = df[index][2264]\n    \n\ndfToronto.sort_values('Income_2016')", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
